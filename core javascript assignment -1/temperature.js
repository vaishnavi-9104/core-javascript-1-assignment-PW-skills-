// Q7. You are building a weather application. Write a JavaScript program that takes the current temperature
// as input and uses the conditional (ternary) operator to determine and print the weather condition. If the
// temperature is above 30Â°C, the condition is "Hot"; otherwise, it is "Moderate".
var temp=40
if(temp>30)
{
    console.log("hot");
}
else{
    console.log("Moderate")
}
